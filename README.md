# mCartoLearn
Location-based mobile learning on relief mapping methods for cartography students using the mCartoLearn mobile app

This app was first developed in 2018 as a part of the master thesis "Mobile Learning (M-Learning) - Concept and Development of an App for the Alpine Cartographic Field School."
The code was later updated and the app has been used exclusively in teaching purposes during the Alpine Cartographic Field School of the international Cartography master program at TU Dresden.
The code version in this repository is the updated code from 2021.
