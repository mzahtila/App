    <string name="info_route">Each of the four quiz topics relates to one of the four checkpoints. You can find the checkpoints marked on the hiking route on the map. These locations relate to questions in quiz topics and will help you in answering them.</string>
    <string name="info_quiz">Complete each of the four topics.</string>
    <string name="info_checkpoints">Each checkpoint represents one cartographic method for displaying relief on maps. Once you start a topic, it’s possible to leave and restart it,  but the ones competed in the first try are better graded at the end! Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair, right?</string>
    <string name="info_lectures1">Each topic is like a small quiz with questions; you need to answer correctly to a question to proceed to the next one. <b>There is no previous theoretical input given!</b> Don’t worry; it is not hard if you focus. <b>Just think at loud, discuss and debate with your colleagues in the group to find correct answers.</b> Some questions are related to previous ones, so remembering the previous correct answers will help you.</string>

    <string name="info_comprehension">At the end of each topic, you will have an open question. Here, you have to put in your own words what you have learned about the cartographic method. Use what you have learned in the previous questions to compel a meaningful summary.</string>
    <string name="info_review_answers">After completing all the checkpoints, you may review your answers to the four open questions. If you like, make changes before submitting them.</string>

    <string name="chk4_question5">5. Evaluate the following statement:\n<i><b>While flat areas might best be mapped with a 5-meter contour interval, stepped terrain may have a 20-meter or larger interval. This is why the contour interval is still specified on the legend of a topographic map.</b></i></string>
    <string name="chk4_question6">6. Look at the example map. What is the approximate elevation difference between the river valley to the south and Südwandhutte if the equidistance is 20 meters?</string>

    <!-- Comprehension questions -->
    <string name="chk1_comprehension_question">Is the choice of colors in elevation tints arbitrary? If not, how should these colors be arranged? Look again around you and argue how many and which colors would you use to represent your surrounding on maps of large and small scales?</string>
